--1.样本分词
hadoop jar /home/hadoop/in/tokenize.jar /user/hdfs/week8/homework/sport /user/hdfs/week8/homework/sport-out

--2.划分样本，80%训练集，20%测试集
processed= load '/user/hdfs/week8/homework/sport-out/part-r-00000' as (category:chararray,doc:chararray);
test = sample processed 0.2;
tfull= JOIN processed BY (category,doc) LEFT OUTER,test BY (category,doc);
t8=  filter tfull BY test::category is null;
train= foreach t8 generate processed::category as category,processed::doc as doc;
store test into '/user/hdfs/week8/homework/test';
store train into '/user/hdfs/week8/homework/train';
  --查看划分结果
test_count = foreach ( group test by category) generate group,COUNT(test.category);
DUMP test_count;
train_count = foreach ( group train by category) generate group,COUNT(train.category);
DUMP train_count;

--3.训练学习集，及测试
